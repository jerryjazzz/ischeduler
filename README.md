# ischeduler
Interactive Scheduler

Simple client-server application that allows a management client app to create tasks and assign them to users. Users then use
another client app to view their tasks. When a user complete a task he/she can mark the task as done so that the people at the
office knows right away that the user has completed the task.

NOTE: This application is designed using a transportation service as an example, however, it can be used as an example for
other applications that have similar goals.
